What's new in Wand 0.4?
=======================

This guide doesn't cover all changes in 0.4.  See also the full list of
changes in :ref:`changelog-0.4.0`.


Complete Drawing API
--------------------

Although Wand 0.3 introduced some basic facilities to draw :ref:`draw-lines`
or :ref:`draw-texts`, these were incomplete.

Since Wand 0.4 :mod:`wand.drawing` it became almost complete.  For more detail
example, see the drawing guide:

- :ref:`draw-arc`
- :ref:`draw-bezier`
- :ref:`draw-circle`
- :ref:`draw-color-and-matte`
- :ref:`draw-composite`
- :ref:`draw-ellipse`
- :ref:`draw-paths`
- :ref:`draw-point`
- :ref:`draw-polygon`
- :ref:`draw-polyline`
- :ref:`draw-push-pop`
- :ref:`draw-rectangles`

Eric McConville did whole of the work alone (:issue:`194`),
huge thanks for his effort!
